# Core Trading Rules
(NIFTY 50 / Index Trading)

## Purpose
These rules are **hard constraints** derived from repeated mistakes and lessons.
They override opinions, biases, and impulses.

If a rule is violated, the trade is invalid — regardless of outcome.

---

## SECTION 1: Market Structure Rules

### Rule 1 — No Trading Without Market Type
Do not take any trade unless the market type is identified as one of:
- Breakdown day
- Range day
- Trend day
- Earnings reaction day

If market type is unclear → **No trade**.

---

### Rule 2 — Range Rules Are Absolute
On range days:
- Avoid CALLs inside the range
- Do not trade the middle of the range
- Treat all trades as scalps

Expectation of trend inside a range is invalid.

---

### Rule 3 — Breakdown Requires Acceptance
A support break is valid only if:
- A candle closes below support
- Price stays below VWAP
- Pullbacks fail near broken support

No acceptance → no breakdown trade.

---

## SECTION 2: VWAP & Volume Rules

### Rule 4 — VWAP Is the Line of Truth
- Long trades below VWAP are invalid
- Short trades above VWAP are invalid
- VWAP reclaim against position = exit immediately

VWAP disagreement overrides all other signals.

---

### Rule 5 — No Option Buying Without Volume
Option buys are allowed only if:
- Volume expands on the move
OR
- Pullbacks are weak and shallow

Low volume + expectation = theta decay.

---

## SECTION 3: Entry & Trade Management Rules

### Rule 6 — No Chasing Late Moves
Do not enter after:
- Large impulsive candle
- 30–40 points already moved from trigger
- Premium expansion without structure

Late entries convert directionally correct trades into losses.

---

### Rule 7 — Partial Profit Is Mandatory on Slow Days
On slow grind or low-momentum days:
- Book partial profits at first target
- Trail stop above pullback high

Holding full position requires momentum confirmation.

---

### Rule 8 — No Averaging Losers
Averaging is allowed only if:
- Original thesis is intact
- VWAP alignment remains
- Market type supports scaling

Otherwise → averaging is prohibited.

---

## SECTION 4: Earnings-Specific Rules

### Rule 9 — First 15 Minutes Are Observation Only
On earnings/result days:
- No trades in first 15 minutes
- Classify reaction pattern first
- Trade only after VWAP + range confirmation

Headlines are irrelevant.

---

### Rule 10 — Trade Reaction, Not Results
Profit/revenue numbers do not justify trades.
Only price reaction vs VWAP and volume matters.

---

## SECTION 5: Risk & Discipline Rules

### Rule 11 — One Bias, One Direction
Do not switch bias repeatedly in the same session.
If bias is invalidated:
- Exit
- Stand aside
- Reassess later

Revenge trades are forbidden.

---

### Rule 12 — Capital Protection Overrides Opportunity
If:
- Two consecutive losing trades occur
- Emotional frustration rises
- Market becomes unreadable

Stop trading for the session.

Preserving capital is a valid outcome.

---

## SECTION 6: Review & Evolution Rules

### Rule 13 — One Rule Update Per Day
At most **one new rule** may be added per trading day.
Rules must be derived from repeated behavior, not one-off events.

Complexity is the enemy.

---

## Core Reminder
Bias is a hypothesis.  
Price is the truth.  
Rules are non-negotiable.
