## 1️⃣ Pre-Market Hypothesis (Before Market Open)

**Overall Bias (choose one):**
- Range-bound with bearish tilt ✅

**Key Global Cues Influencing Today:**
- US markets: Flat to mildly positive after prior volatility; no strong risk-on trigger
- Asian markets: Mixed, lack of clear directional leadership
- Crude / Gold / US yields: Crude stable, gold firm, US yields elevated (risk-off undertone)
- USD/INR: Weak INR, exporter-supportive but risk sentiment cautious

**Key NIFTY 50 Levels Identified Pre-Market:**
- Resistance: 25,400 – 25,450
- Support: 25,200
- Breakdown level: 25,150 → 25,100
- Breakout level: 25,450+

**Preferred Trading Side (before open):**
- PUT only on breakdown
- No CALL inside range

**What Would Invalidate This View?**
- Sustained trade above 25,350–25,400
- VWAP reclaim with volume (VWAP data: not available / needs confirmation)
- Broad-based buying in banks + IT

---

## 2️⃣ Opening Behaviour (9:15–10:00 AM)

**Opening Type:**
- Flat to slightly positive

**Price vs VWAP:**
- Data not available / needs confirmation

**Volume Behaviour:**
- Low to average
- No volume expansion on initial moves

**Initial Market Character:**
- Range-bound open
- Early attempts to move up rejected near resistance
- No impulsive trend

## 3️⃣ Trades Taken (If Any)

### Trade #1
- Instrument: NIFTY 25,200 PE
- Entry Reason: Failure near resistance with acceptance below 25,200
- Entry Price: Near breakdown zone
- Price vs VWAP at entry: Data not available / needs confirmation
- Exit Price: Partial exit as momentum slowed
- Exit Reason: Lack of follow-through, range-bound behaviour
- Result: Small gain / near breakeven (theta pressure)

---

## 4️⃣ What Went RIGHT Today

- Correct identification of range-bound structure
- Resistance zone (25,400+) respected

- Could have booked quicker scalps
- Theta decay underestimated

---

## 6️⃣ Market Type Identified (After Close)

**Today was best described as:**
- Range-bound / Slow Grind ✅

**Was my pre-market read correct?**

(Direction/range correct, momentum expectation slightly optimistic)

**Closing Data:**
- Open: 25,346.20
- High: 25,435.75
