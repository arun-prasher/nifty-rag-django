## 1️⃣ Pre-Market Hypothesis (Before Market Open)

**Overall Bias (choose one):**
- Range-bound with bearish tilt ✅

**Key Global Cues Influencing Today:**
- US markets: Flat to weak, risk appetite muted
- Asian markets: Mixed to weak
- Crude / Gold / US yields: Crude stable, gold firm, US yields elevated (risk-off)
- USD/INR: Weak INR, exporter-supportive but risk sentiment cautious

**Key NIFTY 50 Levels Identified Pre-Market:**
- Resistance: 25,880 – 25,900
- Support: 25,600
- Breakdown level: 25,550 → 25,500
- Breakout level: 25,900+

**Preferred Trading Side (before open):**
- PUT only on breakdown
- No CALL inside range

**What Would Invalidate This View?**
- Sustained VWAP reclaim
- Strong hold above 25,580–25,600 with volume
- Broad-based buying in banks + IT

---

## 2️⃣ Opening Behaviour (9:15–10:00 AM)

**Opening Type:**
- Flat to slightly weak

**Price vs VWAP:**
- Below VWAP (most of the session)

**Volume Behaviour:**
- Low to average
- No expansion on breakdown

**Initial Market Character:**
- Weak breakdown followed by slow, shallow bounces
- No impulsive trend

## 3️⃣ Trades Taken (If Any)

### Trade #1
- Instrument: NIFTY 25,500 PE
- Entry Reason: Acceptance below 25,550 support with bearish bias
- Entry Price: Near breakdown zone
- Price vs VWAP at entry: Below VWAP
- Exit Price: Partial / cautious exit on lack of momentum
- Exit Reason: Slow grind, no follow-through
- Result: Small gain / near breakeven (theta pressure)

---

## 4️⃣ What Went RIGHT Today

- Correct directional bias (bearish)
- Correct identification of key support (25,600) and breakdown zone
- Avoided CALL buying on bounce (capital protection)
- Recognized bounces as pullbacks, not reversals

---

## 5️⃣ What Went WRONG / Could Improve

- Expected momentum after breakdown; market delivered slow grind
- Holding PUT too long on low-momentum price action
- Could have booked partial profits earlier
- Underestimated theta impact on non-trending day

---

## 6️⃣ Market Type Identified (After Close)

**Today was best described as:**
- Weak Trend / Slow Grind ✅

**Was my pre-market read correct?**
- Partially ✅  
(Direction correct, momentum expectation slightly optimistic)

---

## 7️⃣ ONE Rule Update (Very Important)

**Rule Added Today:**
> On breakdown days with low volume, treat trades as scalps and book partial profits early.

---

## 8️⃣ One-Line Market Lesson of the Day

> Correct direction does not guarantee profits without momentum and volume.

---

### 🧠 Reminder
