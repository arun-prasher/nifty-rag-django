## 1️⃣ Pre-Market Hypothesis (Before Market Open)

**Overall Bias (choose one):**
- Range-bound with bearish tilt ✅

**Key Global Cues Influencing Today:**
- Global cues supportive but fragile; no strong trend confirmation
- Crude oil elevated with geopolitical risk premium
- Gold firm (risk hedge demand)
- USD/INR weak → exporter supportive (IT) but overall risk sentiment cautious

**Key NIFTY 50 Levels Identified Pre-Market:**
- Resistance: 25,350 (supply near day high zone)
- Pivot / Balance: 25,290 (previous close)
- Support: 25,050 – 25,025
- Breakdown level: 25,025
- Reclaim level: 25,290+

**Preferred Trading Side (before open):**
- PUT only on breakdown
- No CALL inside range

**What Would Invalidate This View?**
- Sustained reclaim above 25,290 with acceptance
- Break and hold above 25,350
- Broad-based buying in banks + Reliance + IT
