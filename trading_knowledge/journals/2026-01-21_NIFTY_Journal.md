## 1️⃣ Pre-Market Hypothesis (Before Market Open)

**Overall Bias:**  
- Range-bound with bearish tilt (initial bias)

**Key Global Cues Influencing Today:**  
- US markets: Risk-off tone carried into Asia  
- Asian markets: Weak / mixed, not supportive  
- Crude / Gold / US yields: Risk-off backdrop, yields elevated  
- USD/INR: Weak INR (supports IT but reflects caution)

**Key NIFTY 50 Levels Identified Pre-Market:**  
- Resistance: 25,150 – 25,200  
- Support: 25,100  
- Breakdown level: 25,100 → 25,000  
- Breakout / Reclaim level: 25,150+

**Preferred Trading Side (before open):**  
- PUT only below 25,100  
- No CALL until reclaim above 25,150

**What Would Invalidate This View?**  
- False breakdown followed by reclaim above 25,150  
- Stabilisation in banks and Reliance

## 2️⃣ Opening Behaviour (9:15–10:00 AM)

**Opening Type:**  
- Breakdown continuation attempt

**Price Behaviour:**  
- 25,095 → 25,091 → 25,018 (support test)  
- Bounce from 25,018 → 25,045

**Initial Market Character:**  
- Weak continuation  
- Slow grind, no impulsive selling  
- 25,000 acted as magnet and support

## 4️⃣ What Went RIGHT Today

- Correct identification of 25,100 as breakdown level  
- Correctly treated 25,000 as major support  
- Recognised bounce potential from 25,018  
- Correctly identified reclaim above 25,150 as bias flip  

---

## 5️⃣ What Went WRONG / Could Improve

- Breakdown bias held slightly too long  
- Need faster switch when false breakdown is confirmed  
- Avoid overtrading during reclaim retest zone (25,120–25,150)

---

## 6️⃣ Market Type Identified (After Close)

**Market Type:**  
- False Breakdown → Reclaim Day

**Pre-market Read Accuracy:**  
- Partially correct  
- Direction right early, but structure flipped intraday

---

## 7️⃣ ONE Rule Update

> If NIFTY breaks 25,100 but later reclaims 25,150+, treat it as a false breakdown and stop bearish trades unless price falls back below 25,120 and sustains.

---

## 8️⃣ One-Line Market Lesson

> Reclaim beats bias.

---

## 9️⃣ Discipline Check

- Followed plan: Mostly  
- Emotional mistakes: No  
- Overtrading: Avoided

### Reminder  
Bias is a hypothesis.  
Price is the truth.  
Process > Outcome.
