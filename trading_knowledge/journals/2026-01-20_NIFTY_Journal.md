## 1️⃣ Pre-Market Hypothesis (Before Market Open)

**Overall Bias (choose one):**
- Range-bound with bearish tilt ✅

**Key Global Cues Influencing Today:**
- US markets: US futures weak with tariff/trade tensions (risk-off tone)
- Asian markets: Soft-to-mixed → cautious sentiment
- Crude / Gold / US yields: Gold near highs + risk-off bias, yields elevated
- USD/INR: Rupee slipped past 91 intraday → pressure from FPI selling, weak sentiment

**Key NIFTY 50 Levels Identified Pre-Market:**
- Resistance: 25,700–25,750 (supply zone)
- Support: 25,500 (major)
- Breakdown level: 25,450 (acceleration zone)
- Breakout level: 25,750+ (only then recovery possible)

**Preferred Trading Side (before open):**
- PUT on breakdown below 25,500 ✅
- No CALL unless strong VWAP reclaim + above key resistances

**What Would Invalidate This View?**
- Sustained reclaim above 25,600 with VWAP hold + volume confirmation
- Strong breadth recovery led by banks + heavyweights

---

## 2️⃣ Opening Behaviour (9:15–10:00 AM)

**Opening Type:**
- Weak / fragile start (positive GIFT cues failed to convert into strength)

**Price vs VWAP:**
- Below VWAP bias dominated (selling pressure stayed active)

**Volume Behaviour:**
- Selling pressure intensified late-morning → breakdown continuation

**Initial Market Character:**
- Breakdown day structure ✅
- Rallies got sold, leading to a deeper fall into close

---

## 3️⃣ Trades Taken (If Any)

## 4️⃣ What Went RIGHT Today

- Key support 25,500 broke → bearish continuation confirmed ✅
- Breakdown + pullback structure played out clearly (no reversal trap)
- Correct bias: bearish tone strengthened into close
- Recognized the day as risk-off + broad selling (all sectors red)

---

## 5️⃣ What Went WRONG / Could Improve

- Expecting range to hold was invalid once 25,500 broke decisively
- Breakdown days require fast profit booking + strict trailing SL
- Mid-zone scalping becomes dangerous once volatility expands (VIX rising)

---

## 6️⃣ Market Type Identified (After Close)

**Today was best described as:**
- Strong Trend Down / Breakdown Day ✅

**Was my pre-market read correct?**
- Yes ✅  
(25,500 breakdown led to accelerated selling)

---

## 7️⃣ ONE Rule Update (Very Important)

**Rule Added Today:**
> On breakdown days, trade only with VWAP alignment and trail SL above pullback highs—avoid counter-trend entries.

---

## 8️⃣ One-Line Market Lesson of the Day

> When major support breaks and breadth turns red, assume continuation—reversal hopes become expensive.

---

## 9️⃣ Confidence & Discipline Check (Optional)

- Followed plan? Yes ✅
- Emotional mistakes? No ✅
- Overtraded? No ✅

---

### 🧠 Reminder
Bias is a hypothesis.
