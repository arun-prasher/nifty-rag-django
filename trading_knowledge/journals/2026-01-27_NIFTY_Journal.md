::contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

## 2️⃣ Opening Behaviour (9:15–10:00 AM)

**Opening Type:**
- Mild positive bias from futures did not hold

**Price vs VWAP:**

- Early selling pressure after failed initial strength

---

## 3️⃣ Trades Taken (If Any)

### Trade #1
- Instrument: NIFTY 27JAN 25100CE (Call)
- Entry Reason: Attempted late-morning recovery play
- Entry Price: ~₹55-60
- Price vs VWAP at entry: Below VWAP
- Exit Price: Scaled out as decay accelerated
- Exit Reason: Lack of follow-through and structural rejection
- Result: **Loss — risk managed by scaling out**

---

## 4️⃣ What Went RIGHT Today

- Maintained risk discipline after VWAP rejection
- Did not chase fading momentum into the mid-session
- Captured structural reads instead of impulse trades
- Recognised lack of trend and avoided forced bias

---

## 5️⃣ What Went WRONG / Could Improve

- Early option entry was premature (below key structure)
- Could have enforced stricter trigger rules
- Volume and VWAP confirmation could be integrated faster

---

## 6️⃣ Market Type Identified (After Close)

**Today was best described as:**
- Range-bound and bearish drift with late session volatility

**Was my pre-market read correct?**
- Yes — structure remained within expected confines

---

## 7️⃣ Gamma Spike Insight (Post-Session)

**What is a Gamma Spike?**  
Gamma in options measures how rapidly an option’s delta changes as the underlying asset moves. It is highest for *ATM options near expiry*, causing large changes in option premium for relatively small index moves. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

On expiry days (like 27 Jan), ATM options accumulate high gamma, especially when implied volatility has compressed and premium is low. Small underlying movements can then lead to *disproportionately large changes in option prices* — this phenomenon is what traders refer to as a **gamma spike**.

**How it showed up today:**  
- The late session premium uptick in NIFTY 25100CE after prolonged decay was a classic structural gamma effect — premium moved fast even though the index did not trend strongly.
- This is consistent with gamma behaviour near expiry where delta accelerates rapidly near ATM strikes. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

**Gamma Spike Notes (Today):**
- Observed in last ~30-45 mins of trading
- Driven by structural gamma response rather than strong trend
- Premium rise faded without breaking structural levels

**Gamma Rule Addendum:**  
> On expiry days, anticipate volatility pulses from gamma *after* structural triggers (VWAP reclaim or range break), not in isolation.

---

## 8️⃣ ONE Rule Update (Very Important)

**Rule Added Today:**
> Only enter option buys after structural reclaim of VWAP + confirmed momentum.  
> Avoid naked call entries below VWAP, even on entry signals, when gamma is the only short-term force.

---

## 9️⃣ One-Line Market Lesson of the Day

> *Gamma can create fast spikes, but structural acceptance is needed for sustained moves.*

- Emotional mistakes? ❌

**Structure + VWAP + volume** > opinion.  
Process > Outcome.
