## 1️⃣ Pre-Market Hypothesis (Before Market Open)

**Overall Bias (choose one):**  
- Slightly bullish to neutral

**Key Global & Domestic Cues Influencing Today:**  
- Positive domestic sentiment following landmark India-EU Free Trade Agreement news and Q3 earnings. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
- Gift Nifty futures signalled a strong positive open. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

**Key NIFTY 50 Levels Identified Pre-Market:**  
- Resistance: ~25,350 – 25,400

- Support: 25,180 – 25,200  
- Breakdown level: 25,180  
- Reclaim level: 25,300+

**Preferred Pre-Open Trade Bias:**

## 4️⃣ What Went RIGHT Today

- Pre-open bias adapted well to positive structure reclaim  
- Took signals aligned with VWAP and volume confirmation  
- Market participation broadened into sectors (oil & gas, metals) :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

---

## 5️⃣ What Went WRONG / Could Improve

- Slight delay in scaling out; could refine target precision  
- Early session saw some fading strength near resistance

---

## 6️⃣ Market Type Identified (After Close)

**Today was best described as:**  
- Bullish continuation with structural reclaim and momentum

**Was my pre-market read correct?**  
- Mostly — structure and sentiment aligned

---

## 7️⃣ Gamma Behavior (Post-Session)

Gamma effects were **less pronounced** than expiry day prior session. Structural moves dominated premium behavior for ATM strikes near 25,300 levels. Volatility gauge (India VIX) eased, hinting at lower gamma stress. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

**Gamma Rule Check:**  
– Expect gamma-driven pulses primarily around strong structural volatility or expiry days (not today).

---

## 8️⃣ One Rule Update

**Rule Added Today:**  
> On continuation days, prioritize target discipline and unscaled profit booking near structural levels.

---

## 9️⃣ One-Line Market Lesson of the Day

> *Structural reclaim with volume precedes sustained moves more reliably than single-factor signals.*

---

## 🔟 Confidence & Discipline Check

- Followed plan? ✔️  
- Emotional mistakes? ❌  
- Overtraded? ❌
