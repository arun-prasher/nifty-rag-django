# Range Day Playbook (NIFTY 50 / Index Trading)

## Purpose
To correctly identify and survive **range-bound market days**,  
where price moves sideways and **option premium decay (theta)** is the primary risk.

> On range days, capital preservation is alpha.

This playbook applies to:
- NIFTY 50
- Bank NIFTY
- Index options on low-volatility or mixed-signal days

---

## Definition
A range day occurs when NIFTY trades **between well-defined support and resistance**
without sustained acceptance beyond either level.

The market moves, but **does not trend**.

---

## Typical Characteristics
- Mixed or neutral global cues
- No strong sector leadership
- Price oscillates around VWAP
- Breakouts fail quickly
- Volume remains average to low
- Option premiums decay steadily

---

## Early Identification (First 30–45 Minutes)

A day is likely to be a range day if:
- Opening move fails to continue
- Price crosses VWAP multiple times
- First breakout attempt is rejected
- Breadth is mixed (advances ≈ declines)
- India VIX remains stable or falling

If 2–3 of the above are present, **assume range until proven otherwise**.

---

## VWAP Behaviour on Range Days
- VWAP acts as a **mean**, not a trend line
- Price frequently reverts to VWAP
- VWAP breaks are unreliable
- Sustained hold away from VWAP is rare

Trading against VWAP on range days is especially dangerous.

---

## Correct Trading Behaviour

### What TO Do
- Trade only near **range extremes**
- Reduce position size
- Book profits quickly
- Treat trades as **scalps**
- Prefer waiting over forcing trades

### What NOT to Do
- Do not chase breakouts
- Do not hold option buys expecting trend
- Do not trade the middle of the range
- Do not average losing positions
- Do not overtrade

---

## High-Risk Zones (Avoid Trading)
- The middle 40–50% of the range
- Areas with repeated whipsaws
- Times when VWAP is flat and price overlaps it

These zones exist to **destroy option buyers**.

---

## Transition Signals (Range → Trend)

A range day can turn into a trend day ONLY if:
- Price breaks range with strong volume
- VWAP holds in the direction of breakout
- Follow-through occurs for at least 2–3 candles
- Sector leadership emerges (banks / heavyweights)

Until then, treat every move as **mean reversion**.

---

## Invalidations (Exit / Stand Down)

Exit or stop trading if:
- You feel compelled to trade every move
- Multiple small losses occur
- Price action becomes noisy and unreadable
- Emotional frustration increases

No trade is a valid trade on range days.

---

## Common Range-Day Traps
- “This breakout will surely work”
- Trading every VWAP cross
- Confusing volatility with direction
- Ignoring theta decay
- Overconfidence from small wins

---

## Mental Model

Range days are designed to test patience, not skill.

Survival > activity.

---

## Related Rules
- Avoid CALLs inside a defined range.
- Do not trade the middle of the range.
- On low-volatility days, reduce trade frequency.
- Protect capital when market gives no edge.
