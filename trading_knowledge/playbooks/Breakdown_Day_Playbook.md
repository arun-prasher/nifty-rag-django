# Breakdown Day Playbook (NIFTY 50 / Index Trading)

## Definition
A breakdown day occurs when NIFTY breaks a **well-defined support level**
and price **accepts below it**, often accompanied by rising volatility.

Acceptance matters more than the break itself.

---

## Typical Characteristics
- Prior day was range-bound or weak
- Support breaks after repeated testing
- VWAP remains above price
- Pullbacks fail near broken support
- Option premiums expand early, then decay if momentum slows

---

## Confirmation Signals (ALL must align)
- Support level breaks on 5-min close
- Price stays below VWAP
- Volume expands on breakdown OR
  volume stays steady but pullbacks are weak
- Breadth weakens (more stocks red than green)

---

## Common Trap on Breakdown Days
- Expecting continuous momentum
- Holding PUTs too long on slow grind
- Confusing pullback with reversal
- Late entries after large candles

---

## Correct Trading Behaviour
- Enter on **breakdown confirmation**, not late chase
- Treat first move as **momentum scalp**
- Book partial profits near first target
- Trail stop above pullback high
- Reduce position size if volatility spikes suddenly

---

## Invalidations (EXIT immediately)
- Strong VWAP reclaim with volume
- Support reclaimed and held for 2–3 candles
- Broad-based buying led by banks or heavyweights

---

## What NOT to Do
- Do not buy CALLs below broken support
- Do not average losing PUTs
- Do not trade mid-range after breakdown
- Do not assume trend continuation without volume

---

## Mental Model
Breakdown gives opportunity early.  
The pullback decides whether it becomes a trend or a trap.

---

## Related Rules
- On breakdown days with low volume, treat trades as scalps and book partial profits early.
- Exit immediately if VWAP reclaim invalidates bias.
