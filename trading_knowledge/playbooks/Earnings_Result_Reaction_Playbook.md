# Earnings Result Reaction Playbook
(NIFTY 50 & Heavyweight Stocks)

## Purpose
To correctly interpret how the market is reacting to earnings results,
using **price, VWAP, and volume**, instead of headlines or opinions.

> Earnings are information.  
> Price action is judgment.

This playbook applies primarily to:
- NIFTY 50 heavyweights
- Index-moving stocks
- Earnings days and post-earnings sessions

---

## Core Principle
Markets trade on **expectations vs reality**, not on absolute profit or revenue numbers.

A “good result” can still lead to selling  
if expectations were higher.

---

## The First 15-Minute Rule (Non-Negotiable)

No trades are taken **in the first 15 minutes** after market open on result days.

The first 15 minutes are used only to:
- Observe
- Classify
- Decide bias

---

## Phase-Based Reading Framework

### Phase 1: Minute 0–5 (The Open)

Observe:
- Gap type:
  - Gap Up
  - Gap Down
  - Flat
- Volume on first 5-min candle:
  - High
  - Average
  - Low
- Price relative to VWAP:
  - Above VWAP
  - Below VWAP

Interpretation:
- Gap + High Volume = Institutional intent
- Gap + Low Volume = Fragile / suspect move

---

### Phase 2: Minute 5–10 (The Test)

Observe:
- Does price hold the opening high/low?
- Is there a sharp retracement?
- How does price behave near VWAP?

Key signals:
- VWAP rejection = continuation likely
- Clean VWAP reclaim = sentiment shift
- Fast retrace = gap may fill

---

### Phase 3: Minute 10–15 (The Verdict)

Ask ONE question:
> Where is price relative to VWAP, with volume?

This determines the trade bias for the session.

## Opening Range Rule (15-Minute Structure)

  - High of first 15 minutes
  - Low of first 15 minutes

After 15 minutes:

- Inside range → No trade (chop)
