# Gamma Blast Playbook (NIFTY Intraday Options)

**Purpose:**  
Anticipate late-session gamma spikes in NIFTY options **without holding naked directional risk**.

> Gamma blasts are rare, mechanical events.  
> This playbook is about *process, survival, and asymmetric payoff* — not prediction.

---

## 1. What Is a Gamma Blast?

A **gamma blast** is a short, sharp premium expansion in near-ATM options (often near expiry) driven by:
- Rapid delta changes (high gamma)
- Dealer hedging / short covering
- Time pressure late in the session

It usually happens **after hours of decay**, not after strength.

---

## 2. The Gamma Zone Checklist (Non‑Negotiable)

A gamma blast is *possible* only when **most** of these are true:

- **Time window:** After 13:30 IST  
  *Highest probability: 14:30–15:10 (expiry day intensifies this)*

- **Strike location:**  
  Spot near **ATM** or within **±50 points** of a high-OI strike

- **Premium state:**  
  Option premium already crushed (≈ ₹10–25)  
  Repeated failures below option VWAP

- **Market regime:**  
  Compression / coiling  
  Overlapping candles, failed follow-through  
  ❌ Not a clean trend

- **Trigger energy nearby:**  
  VWAP, range high/low, prior breakdown zone

- **Risk context:**  
  No major event risk in next 10–20 minutes  
  (or size must be tiny)

> If one key condition is missing → **no gamma trade**

## 3. How to Monitor Without Guessing Direction

You do **not** predict direction.  
You watch **mechanical stress points**.

Monitor:

- **Index vs VWAP**
  - Below VWAP → sellers dominate
  - Reclaim + hold → possible ignition

- **Range compression**
  - Tight candles into VWAP or range boundary

- **Option tape**
  - Sudden volume jump + fast premium lift after decay  
    → often short covering

- **OI magnet**
  - Spot pinned near a large OI strike  
  - Break away = hedging acceleration

- **Time pressure**
  - Last 45 minutes force dealers/writers to flatten risk

## 4. Trade Structures That Limit Risk

Choose structure based on experience.  
Theme: **defined risk + trigger + time stop**

### A. Micro ATM Straddle (Beginner‑friendly)

**When:**  
You expect a burst but have no directional bias

**Structure:**  
- Buy ATM Call (₹10–25)  
- Buy ATM Put (₹10–25)

**Rules:**  
- Very small size  
- Only inside Gamma Zone

**Exit:**  
- Combined premium +30–60% → exit  
- Hard time stop by **15:10**

---

### B. Reaction Entry (VWAP Reclaim)

**When:**  
You want lower false-start risk

**Entry Rule:**  
- Index closes **above VWAP for 2 full 5‑min candles**
- Forms a higher low (bull) / lower high (bear)

**Structure:**  
- Buy ATM option (call or put)

**Exit:**  
- Trail below VWAP  
- Exit immediately if VWAP is lost

---

### C. Backspread (Convex / Lottery)

**When:**  
You want asymmetry with defined risk

**Example (Bullish):**
- Sell 1 ATM Call
- Buy 2 OTM Calls (50–100 pts away)

**Rules:**  
- Build late day only  
- Never early session

**Exit:**  
- No move by 15:10 → close  
- Blast occurs → trail aggressively

---

### D. Debit Spread (Controlled Cost)

**When:**  
You want less IV damage

**Structure:**  
- Buy ATM option  
- Sell OTM option in same direction

**Rules:**  
- Only after trigger  
- No mid‑range entries

**Exit:**  
- Near resistance / range extreme  
- Time stop mandatory

---

## 5. Execution Rules (Survival Layer)

Most gamma trades **fail**.  
Your edge is **risk control**.

- Size assuming trade can go to zero
- ❌ No averaging
- Always use a **time stop** (e.g. 15:10)
- Trade **index triggers**, not option hope
- Scale out into vertical candles
- One‑trade rule: max 1–2 attempts per session

---

## 6. The 3‑Stage Gamma Blast Map

### Stage 1: Decay + Compression
- Options bleed
- Candles overlap
- Spot sticks near a strike
- VWAP acts as resistance/support

**Action:**  
Stand aside or build *tiny* structure only if in Gamma Zone

---

### Stage 2: Ignition (Trigger)
- Index breaks VWAP or range
- Option volume spikes
- Premium lifts fast

**Action:**  
Enter on trigger or hold prebuilt structure  
Do **not** add size late

---

### Stage 3: Blow‑off + Mean Reversion
- Vertical candles
- Long wicks
- Stalling near VWAP or resistance

**Action:**  
Scale out aggressively  
Exit remainder if VWAP is lost

---

## 7. Late‑Session Playbook (14:30 → Close)

**14:30–14:40**
- Identify ATM + high-OI strikes
- Mark VWAP + range high/low

**14:40–14:55**
- Wait for compression into a level
- No trade mid‑range

**Trigger A (Bull):**
- 2× 5‑min closes above VWAP + higher low  
→ Buy ATM call / debit spread

**Trigger B (Bear):**
- 2× 5‑min closes below VWAP + lower high  
→ Buy ATM put / debit spread

**Non‑Directional:**
- Premium crushed + compression  
→ Small ATM straddle

**15:05–15:10**
- No ignition → exit  
- Ignition → scale out into spikes

---

## 8. Quick Reference Card

### Enter Only If
- Time: 14:30–15:10
- Premium: ₹10–25 (crushed)
- Spot near ATM / high‑OI strike
- Compression into VWAP / range

### Never Do
- Average a dying option
- Chase late green candles without acceptance
- Bet big on one candle
- Ignore time stop

### Best Trigger
- 2× 5‑min closes beyond VWAP  
  + higher low (bull) / lower high (bear)

### Exits
- Take partials into vertical moves
- Trail below VWAP or last swing
- Hard time stop by 15:10

## Final Mental Model

> **You don’t chase gamma.  
> You build traps where gamma might trip.**

Most days it won’t.  
You survive those days — and thrive on the few that do.
