## ⏱️ Phase 1: Minute 0–5 (The Open)

### Observe (Do NOT trade)

## ⏱️ Phase 2: Minute 5–10 (The Test)

### Watch carefully
- Does price:
  - Hold the opening low (gap down case)?
  - Hold the opening high (gap up case)?
- VWAP interaction:
  - VWAP rejection?
  - VWAP reclaim?

### Key signals
- Rejection at VWAP = continuation
- Clean reclaim of VWAP = sentiment shift
- Sharp retrace = gap may fill

## ⏱️ Phase 3: Minute 10–15 (The Verdict)

### Focus on ONE thing
> Where is price relative to VWAP with volume?

This decides the trade bias for the day.
