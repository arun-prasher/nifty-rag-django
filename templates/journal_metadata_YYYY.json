# WHAT NOT TO DO (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

❌ Do not redesign the system frequently  
❌ Do not add new playbooks casually  
❌ Do not tag unclear days just for completeness  
❌ Do not ask for buy/sell signals  
❌ Do not chase perfection  

Consistency beats intensity.

# SUCCESS METRIC (ONLY ONE)

Do NOT judge success by daily P&L.

Judge success by:

> **Did I violate any Core Rule today?**

- Zero violations → successful day
- One or more violations → review required

Money follows discipline.

# OPTIONAL FUTURE UPGRADES

Only consider these **after** consistent execution:

1. “Should I Trade Today?” Yes/No Gate
2. Python-based RAG automation
3. Auto-generated weekly summaries
4. Advanced metadata filtering

Do NOT upgrade prematurely.

## FINAL REMINDER

> You are no longer trying to predict the market.  
> You are training a system to recognize **when you have an edge**.

Boring execution is a feature, not a flaw.
